#NotchKiller
This is a magisk module I made to ignore the notch.
Notch is now used for games and apps! (No more black bars)

!!!! I only tested this on xiaomi mi a2 lite! Use at your own risk.
!!!! This should work on AOSP roms.
!!!! ONLY ANDROID 9 SUPPORT.
!!!! AGAIN. TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK. 

Please tweet at me @zigafide if this module works on your phone. I will add it to the list of compatibility. 

HOW TO USE:
Go into android dev options: go to the cutout emulation, then choose: "Notch Killer"
